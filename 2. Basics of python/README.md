### Title

Introduction to Python: Data Types in Python

---

### Aim

To study and understand the basic data types available in Python.

---

### Algorithm

1. Start the Python environment.
2. Declare variables with different types of values.
3. Identify the data types of the variables.
4. Classify the data types into categories.
5. Observe the characteristics of each data type.
6. Stop the program.

---

### Objectives

1. To learn the basic built-in data types in Python.
2. To understand the classification of Python data types.
3. To identify the importance of data types in programming.

### Theory

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that supports various built-in data types. A data type specifies the kind of value a variable can store and determines the operations that can be performed on it. In Python, the data type is automatically assigned when a value is given to a variable.

The commonly used basic data types in Python are:

1. **Numeric Data Types** – Used to store numbers such as integers and decimal values.
2. **String Data Type** – Used to store a sequence of characters.
3. **Boolean Data Type** – Used to represent logical values such as true or false.
4. **List Data Type** – Used to store multiple values in an ordered form.
5. **Tuple Data Type** – Used to store multiple values in an ordered form.
6. **Dictionary Data Type** – Used to store data in key-value pairs.
7. **Set Data Type** – Used to store unique elements.

Data types play a crucial role in programming because they define how data is stored, processed, and managed within a program. Proper understanding of data types helps in writing clear, efficient, and error-free programs.

### Conclusion

Thus, the basic data types in Python were studied and understood. The classification and purpose of each data type were learned, which forms the foundation for writing effective Python programs.
