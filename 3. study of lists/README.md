# Experiment-3
Aim: Study of lists in Python

Algorithm: (i) Marks List Program:
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Initialize the list marks = [90, 82, 66, 76, 33]
Step 3: Display maximum and minimum values of the list
Step 4: Display the length and sum of the list
Step 5: Display the sorted list and calculate the average
Step 6: Sort and display the original list
Step 7: Stop

(ii) Grocery list program:
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Create a list grocery with initial items
Step 3: Add new items to the list using append()
Step 4: Remove specified items from the list using remove()
Step 5: Display the final list
Step 6: Stop


Theory:
a)A list is a collection of ordered and mutable elements. Lists can store multiple values in a single variable.
b)The insert() method inserts an element at a specified index in the list.
c)Negative indexing accesses elements from the end of the list, where -1 refers to the last element.
d)Slicing is used to extract a part of a list. It follows the format [start : end], where the end index is excluded.
e)The append() method adds a single element at the end of the list.
f)The insert() method inserts an element at a specified index in the list.
g)The extend() method adds all elements of one list to another list.
h)The sorted()Returns a new list containing all elements sorted in ascending order without modifying the original list.
i)The remove() method deletes the first occurrence of a specified element from the list.

Conclusion:
This experiment shows how Python lists are used to manage data. The marks program analyzes student marks, while the grocery list program adds and removes items, helping to understand basic list operations clearly.
