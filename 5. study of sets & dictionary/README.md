## Theory: Sets
A dictionary is a data structure that stores information in key–value pairs, where keys are unique and values can be modified. Dictionary values can be updated by accessing the key and assigning a new value using the assignment operator. Searching in a dictionary is done using the get() method or the in keyword to check whether a key exists. Conditional statements such as if–else are used to control the flow of the program. Built-in functions like max() help in finding the highest value in a dictionary. The input() function is used to accept data from the user, making the program interactive and efficient.
Elements cannot be modified individually, but new elements can be added using the add() or update() methods and removed using remove() or discard(). 
The in keyword is used to check whether an element exists in a set. Python supports mathematical set operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.
## Frozen Set
A frozenset is an immutable set whose elements cannot be changed. Sets are efficient for handling unique data, fast membership testing, and performing mathematical 
and comparison operations.

## Theory: Dictionary
A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements used to store distinct values. Sets are created using curly braces {} or the set() constructor
and automatically remove duplicate elements.  
Some important commands commonly used in set:  
add() – Adds a single element.  
update() – Adds multiple elements.  
remove() – Removes an element.   
discard() – Removes an element without raising an errorSet Operations.  

## Conclusion:
Thus, the study of sets in Python was successfully completed. We learned how to create sets, add and remove elements, check membership, and perform various set operations. The program also effectively demonstrates the use of dictionaries, conditional statements, built-in functions, and user input in Python.
