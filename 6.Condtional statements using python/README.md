# Experiment 6

## Title

To Study and Implement Conditional Statements in Python

## Aim

To study and implement conditional statements in Python for decision-making.

## Algorithm

Start the program.

Declare variable(s) or take input from the user.

Apply the conditional statement to check the given condition.

If the condition is true, execute the corresponding statement.

If the condition is false, execute the alternative statement.

Display the result.

Stop the program.

## Objectives

To understand the concept of conditional statements in Python.

To learn how to use conditional statements for decision-making.

To implement programs using conditional statements.

To understand how program execution depends on conditions.

## Theory

Conditional statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program based on certain conditions. They allow the program to make decisions and execute specific blocks of code depending on whether the condition is true or false.

In Python, conditional statements are implemented using if, if-else, and if-elif-else statements. The if statement is used to check a condition and execute a block of code if the condition is true. The if-else statement is used when there are two possible outcomes based on a condition. The if-elif-else statement is used when multiple conditions need to be checked.

These statements use relational and logical operators to evaluate conditions. Based on the result of the condition, the program executes the appropriate block of code.

Conditional statements are important in programming because they allow programs to make decisions, perform different actions, and solve real-world problems efficiently.

## Conclusion

Thus, conditional statements in Python were studied and implemented successfully. Their role in decision-making and controlling the flow of program execution was understood.
