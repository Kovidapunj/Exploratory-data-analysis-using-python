# Experiment 6
Aim - To study and implement conditional statements in Python

Algorithm

Start the program.

Take the required input from the user.

Apply conditional statements (if, elif, else) to evaluate the given condition(s).

Execute the corresponding block of code based on the condition’s result.

Display the output.

Stop the program.

Theory

Conditional statements in Python are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. They allow a program to evaluate expressions and execute specific code blocks only when certain conditions are satisfied. This decision-making capability is essential for building logical and real-world applications.

Python mainly uses the following conditional statements:

if statement – executes a block of code when a condition is true.

if-else statement – executes one block if the condition is true and another if it is false.

if-elif-else statement – checks multiple conditions sequentially and executes the block corresponding to the first true condition.

Nested if statement – an if statement placed inside another if statement for complex decision-making.

Conclusion - Conditional statements form the backbone of decision-making in Python programming. By using if, if-else, and if-elif-else structures, programs can respond dynamically to different inputs and situations. This study demonstrates how conditional logic improves program flexibility, accuracy, and real-world applicability, making it an essential concept for effective Python programming.
