## Study of Loops in Python

---

## AIM

To study and understand the concept of looping constructs in Python and implement iterative statements using `for` and `while` loops.

---

## OBJECTIVES

1. To understand the need for loops in programming.
2. To study the syntax and working of `while` loop.
3. To study the syntax and working of `for` loop.
4. To understand loop control statements such as `break`, `continue`, and `pass`.
5. To implement simple programs using loops.

---

## ALGORITHM

 Start.
 Select the appropriate loop (`for` loop when number of iterations is known, `while` loop when condition-based repetition is required).
 Initialize control variable (if using `while` loop).
 Write the loop condition.
 Execute the statements inside the loop body.
 Update the control variable (if required).
 Repeat until the condition becomes false.
 Stop.

## THEORY 

In programming, loops are control structures that allow a set of statements to be executed repeatedly until a specified condition is satisfied. They help in reducing code redundancy and improving efficiency.

Python provides two primary types of loops:

### 1. While Loop

The `while` loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as the given condition evaluates to True. It is an entry-controlled loop because the condition is checked before the execution of the loop body.

**Syntax:**

```python
while condition:
    statements
```

If the condition becomes False, the loop terminates.

---

### 2. For Loop

The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence such as list, tuple, string, or range. It is generally used when the number of iterations is known in advance.

**Syntax:**

```python
for variable in sequence:
    statements
```

The loop automatically assigns values from the sequence to the variable during each iteration.

---

### Loop Control Statements

* **break:** Terminates the loop immediately.
* **continue:** Skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.
* **pass:** Acts as a placeholder and performs no action.

Loops play a crucial role in solving repetitive computational problems efficiently.

## Conclusion

Thus, the concept of loops in Python was studied and implemented successfully. Both `for` and `while` loops were understood along with their syntax and working. Loop control statements were also examined. It is concluded that loops are essential constructs in Python programming for performing repetitive tasks efficiently and effectively.
