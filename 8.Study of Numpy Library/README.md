## Theory:

NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open-source Python library used for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

The core feature of NumPy is the ndarray (N-dimensional array) object. Unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays store elements of the same data type, which makes them faster and more memory efficient.

Features of NumPy:

Multi-dimensional Arrays:
NumPy supports one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and higher-dimensional arrays.

Efficient Computation:
NumPy performs element-wise operations faster than traditional Python lists.

Mathematical Functions:
Provides built-in functions for arithmetic, trigonometric, statistical, and algebraic operations.

Indexing and Slicing:
Allows accessing and modifying array elements easily.

Broadcasting:
Enables arithmetic operations between arrays of different shapes under certain conditions.

NumPy is widely used in data analysis, machine learning, scientific computing, and engineering applications due to its speed and efficiency.

## Conclusion:

Thus, the NumPy library was studied and its features were understood. It was observed that NumPy arrays provide faster and more efficient numerical computations compared to Python lists. The library is essential for scientific and data-oriented applications in Python.
