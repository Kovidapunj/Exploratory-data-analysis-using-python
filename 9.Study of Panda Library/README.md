# Experiment 9

Study of Panda Libraries

## Aim:
To study the Pandas library in Python and understand its use for data manipulation and analysis.

## Objectives:

To understand the purpose of the Pandas library.

To study the basic data structures in Pandas.

To learn how to create and manipulate data using Pandas.

To perform basic data analysis operations.

To understand the importance of Pandas in data science applications.

# Algorithm
Start.
 Import the Pandas library using import pandas as pd.
 Create a Series or DataFrame.
 Perform operations such as indexing, selection, and filtering.
 Apply functions for data analysis (sorting, grouping, summarizing).
 Display the output.
 Stop.


## Theory:
Pandas is an open-source Python library used for data analysis and manipulation. It provides powerful and flexible data structures designed to handle structured data efficiently.

The two primary data structures in Pandas are:

### 1. Series

A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type.

### 2. DataFrame

A two-dimensional labeled data structure with rows and columns, similar to a table in a database or spreadsheet.

Key Features of Pandas:

Data Handling:
Efficient handling of missing data.

Data Manipulation:
Supports filtering, sorting, grouping, merging, and reshaping of data.

File Handling:
Can read and write data from various file formats such as CSV, Excel, and JSON.

Statistical Functions:
Provides built-in methods for calculating mean, median, standard deviation, and other statistical measures.

Pandas is widely used in data science, machine learning, finance, and research fields due to its powerful data analysis capabilities.


## Conclusion:

Thus, the Pandas library was studied and implemented successfully. It was observed that Pandas provides efficient tools for data manipulation and analysis. The DataFrame and Series structures make handling structured data simple and effective, making Pandas an essential library for data-related applications.
