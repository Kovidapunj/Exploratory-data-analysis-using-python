# Experiment 9

Study of Python Libraries

## Aim:

To study Python libraries and understand their role in simplifying programming tasks and enhancing functionality.

## Objectives:

To understand the concept of libraries in Python.

To study the types of Python libraries.

To learn how to import and use libraries in Python programs.

To understand the importance of libraries in real-world applications.

## Algorithm:

Start.
Identify the required functionality for the program.
Import the necessary Python library using the import statement.
Access functions or modules from the library.
Execute the program using the imported library features.
Display the output.
Stop.

## Theory:

A Python library is a collection of pre-written modules and functions that help programmers perform specific tasks without writing code from scratch. Libraries improve productivity, reduce development time, and enhance program efficiency.

Python provides two main types of libraries:

### 1. Standard Library

The Python Standard Library comes pre-installed with Python. It contains modules for file handling, mathematical operations, date and time processing, operating system interaction, and more.

Examples include:

Mathematical operations

Random number generation

File and directory management

#### 2. External Libraries

These libraries are developed by third parties and must be installed separately. They are widely used in data science, web development, machine learning, and automation.

Examples include:

Numerical computing libraries

Data analysis libraries

Visualization libraries

Libraries are imported using the import keyword. Once imported, their functions can be used in the program.

Libraries make Python powerful and suitable for various domains such as scientific computing, web development, artificial intelligence, and automation.

## Conclusion:

Thus, the concept of Python libraries was studied. It was observed that libraries provide pre-defined functions and modules that simplify programming tasks. The use of libraries enhances efficiency, reduces coding effort, and enables the development of advanced applications in Python.
